## Project Overview ðŸ“„

### Overview

**Tagline**: Bono Network - Decentralizing Justice through Blockchain and AI

**Brief Description**:  
Bono is a decentralized legal infrastructure platform aiming to democratize access to justice globally. By integrating blockchain technology, AI (Codename Arbiter), and a global network of vetted law firms (the High Table), Bono provides affordable and accessible legal services across jurisdictions. Our mission is to modernize the legal industry by lowering the barriers to entry, increasing transparency, and protecting vulnerable individuals through innovative technology solutions like zero-knowledge proofs and immutable legal records, Worldwide.

**Relation to Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama**:  
Bono intends to leverage Substrate to build a blockchain-based legal infrastructure that is interoperable, secure, and scalable. By integrating with Polkadot, Bono can ensure cross-chain compatibility and high levels of security for legal document verification, tokenization of litigation, and decentralized governance mechanisms.

**Why We Are Building Bono**:  
Access to justice is a fundamental right, yet the current legal system is often inaccessible due to high costs, inefficiencies, and jurisdictional barriers. Bono seeks to bridge this gap by utilizing blockchain and AI technologies to create a transparent, efficient, and global legal platform. Read our [Whitepaper](https://bit.ly/bono-whitepaper) for more information on how we plan to achieve this.

## Project Details

### Technical Components

1. **Bono Core**  
   - **Description**: Development of smart contracts for legal document approvals, integration with the High Table network, and verification of documents.
   - **Technology Stack**: Substrate-based smart contracts, Polkadot integration, IPFS for document storage, KYC layer (currently Concordium) for member verification.

2. **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Module**  
   - **Description**: Implementation of zero-knowledge proofs for verifying legal documents without revealing sensitive information. This module also aims to protect political dissidents by preventing false targeting through international organizations like Interpol.
   - **Technology Stack**: ZK-SNARKs/ZK-STARKs integrated with Substrate, utilizing Rust for development.

3. **GitLaw**  
   - **Description**: An open-source, version-controlled repository of laws and regulations that integrates into Substrate to create an immutable record. This ensures that Codename Arbiter has access to up-to-date legal information across different jurisdictions. The immutable record will be in Sync with a DB on Github + Gitlab
   - **GitHub Repository**: [GitLaw Repository](https://github.com/BonoNetwork/Gitlaw)
   - **Technology Stack**: Integration with Substrate, use of IPFS or other technologies for decentralized storage.

4. **Decentralized Treasury System**  
   - **Description**: A treasury system that supports the High Table token mechanism, where staked tokens represent a seigniorage of assets like BTC, DOT, ETH, etc. Their value grows based on a variety of strategies, along with the protocol gains from Bono.
   - **Technology Stack**: Smart contracts (EVM/Solidity Mostly), integration with DeFi protocols (Pendle locks,yield markets etc).

5. **Blockchain of Law**  
   - **Description**: A collaborative effort between Bono and the Web3 Foundation to create a dedicated blockchain for legal processes. Initially, Bono will launch as a protocol and remain blockchain-agnostic at the core level, ensuring interoperability and broad adoption.
   - **Technology Stack**: Custom Substrate-based blockchain, interoperability with Polkadot ecosystem. 
   - **RWA & Case Tokenization**: Making Litigation Bonds More Accessible, especially in less developed regions. This can solve some economics of litigation.
### Documentation

- **UI Mockups and Designs**: Available upon request and included in the project documentation.
  ![bono](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bed1a49d-056e-4e80-9af0-130527efbf94)
- **API Specifications**: Detailed API documentation for Bono Core, ZK Module, and GitLaw is provided in our technical documents.
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Detailed diagrams illustrating the interaction between different modules, smart contracts, and external systems are included in our [documentation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKkLBlTE=/).

### What Bono Is Not

- Bono is not a replacement for traditional legal systems but a complementary infrastructure aiming to enhance accessibility and efficiency.
- Bono does not provide legal advice; instead, it facilitates connections between users and legal professionals through the High Table network.
- The project does not focus on tokenomics or revenue generation strategies within this application.

---

## Ecosystem Fit

- **Where and How It Fits**: Bono fills a crucial gap by providing a legal infrastructure layer that enables secure, cross-chain legal processes. It enhances the utility of the Polkadot network by introducing legal document verification, decentralized governance, and indirect AI integration.
- **Target Audience**: Individuals seeking affordable legal services, law firms wanting to expand their reach, political dissidents requiring protection, and developers interested in building legal tech solutions.
- **Needs Addressed**:
  - **Access to Justice**: Making legal services affordable and accessible, especially in cross jurisdiction cases.
  - **Document Verification**: Secure and immutable verification of legal documents.
  - **Protection of Vulnerable Individuals**: Using ZK proofs to protect sensitive information.
- **Identification of Needs**: Through extensive research, including studies on global access to justice, interviews with legal professionals, and analysis of cross-border legal challenges.
- **Similar Projects in Ecosystem**: While there are projects focusing on decentralized identity and document notarization, none combine AI, legal infrastructure, and cross-jurisdictional capabilities as Bono does.

## Development Roadmap ðŸ”©

### Overview
**Brief**: Unlike many other projects in the crypto space, Bono aims to solve a problem first and then scale the solution as demand grows, rather than building a massive infrastructure that is not used by anyone. Our Pilot case targets over 100,000 individuals in 9 seperate legal cases for over 250 million dollars. Bono's solution will be the only way to reliably solve these complex multijurisdiction, global cases. The Following road map and its milestones are the steps that will be taken to prove our solution works.

- **Total Estimated Duration**: 4 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)**: 3
- **Total Costs**:  $112,000
- **DOT %**: 50%

## Future Plans


### Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Module + Privacy Layer

We plan to develop a **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Module** to implement zero-knowledge proofs for verifying legal documents without revealing sensitive information. This module will also protect individuals like political dissidents from false targeting and ensure their data remains confidential. Integration with Bono Core will enhance privacy and security.

### GitLaw Integration and Decentralized Treasury System

- **GitLaw Integration**: GitLaw will integrate into the Substrate framework to maintain an immutable, version-controlled record of laws and regulations, ensuring up-to-date legal information for our AI Arbiter and legal professionals.
  
- **Decentralized Treasury System**: We plan to develop a treasury system supporting the High Table token mechanism, where staked tokens represent BTC, DOT, ETH, etc., and grow through scalable strategies and protocol gains. The architecture can be modular for use by other projects.

---

## Additional Information âž•

- **Plaza Integration**: We are preparing for Plaza integration to align Bono with Polkadotâ€™s future developments. Writing smart contracts in Solidity ensures readiness for deployment on Plaza, which consolidates functionalities into a scalable chain.
- **Classified Information**: Classified documents, partnerships, and additional materials have been submitted via email to [grants@web3.foundation](mailto:grants@web3.foundation) as requested.
- **Community and Partnerships**: Collaborations with multiple law firms and organizations broaden our reach and impact.
- **Incorporation Status**: We are mid-process, with Switzerland or Luxembourg as potential jurisdictions.
- **How Did You Hear About the Grants Program?**: Through discussions with Mr. Piet Wolff during the office hours and engagement with the Polkadot community.
- **Previous Grants**: This is our first application for a grant from the Web3 Foundation. Bono Has yet to apply for other grants.
